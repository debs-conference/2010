     <h5><a name="industry"></a>Call for Papers: Industry Track</h5>
</div>

<p><b>Author Instructions.</b> Two types of papers will be accepted in the Industrial Track: industry papers and experience papers.
</p>
<p> Topics for both types of papers cover the full range of distributed event-based systems, including event processing, messaging, middleware, event-driven architectures, and context awareness. </p>
<p><b>Industry Papers</b> describe innovative commercial event-based system implementations, novel applications of event technology, and experience applying recent research advances to practical situations. These papers follow the standard format of a research paper and should present novel work.</p>
<p><b>Experience Papers</b> describe the experience with a deployed industrial system. The purpose of these papers is to give visibility to the different applications of event-based technology. The paper should describe the problem, the design and implementation of the solution, experience with the deployment, remaining technical challenges, and the potential for future work. Papers need not approach the process with the rigor of a research paper, but should include performance or complexity metrics if possible. In the interest of confidentiality some details may be omitted, but the paper must focus on a specific deployment and application, rather than a class of applications or a marketing message.</p>

     <h5><a name="posters_demo"></a>Call for Posters, Demos and Fast Abstracts 
</h5>
</div>


<p><b>Poster papers</b> provide an excellent forum for authors to present their
work in an informal and interactive setting. Posters are ideal to
showcase speculative, late-breaking results or to introduce
interesting, innovative work. Posters sessions are highly
interactive. They allow authors and interested participants to connect
to each other and to engage in discussions about the work
presented. Posters provide authors with a unique opportunity to draw
attention to their work during the conference. Accepted contributions
will be published in electronic form and are limited to 2 pages.
</p>
<p><b>Demo papers</b> report on an existing research prototype by clearly
identifying the original contributions and ideas demonstrated. The
authors are expected to prepare a poster and perform a live software
demonstration on their own laptop during an exhibit-style conference
reception. Any special requirements should be identified in the
appendix of the paper. Accepted contributions will be published in
electronic form and are limited to 2 pages.
</p>

<p><b>Fast Abstracts</b> at DEBS are short presentations (5 minutes), either on
new ideas or work in progress, or opinion pieces that can address any
issue relevant to distributed events. Because they are brief and have
a later deadline, Fast Abstracts enable their authors to summarise
work that is not yet complete, put forward novel or challenging ideas,
state positions on controversial issues, suggest new approaches to the
solution of open problems without having fully verified it.  Fast
Abstracts are aimed at academics and practitioners, junior and senior
researchers, promoting a rich exchange of experiences. Thus, they
provide an excellent opportunity to introduce new work, or present
radical opinions, and receive early feedback from the community.
Please note however that fast abstracts will NOT be included in the
proceedings.
</p>

<p>Contributions are particularly solicited from industrial practitioners
and academics that may not have been able to prepare full papers due
to time and work pressure, but nevertheless seek an opportunity to
engage with the DEBS community.
</p>

<p>Posters, Demos and Fast Abstracts cover the same <a href="calls.php.html#scope">interest areas</a> as the
Research Papers.</p>

<p>
<b>Submission Content.</b>
Submissions will be evaluated both on their contributions and on how
effectively they communicate those contributions.
</p>

<p>All <em>posters</em> should include the following information:</p>
<ul> 
  <li>The purpose and goals of the work.</li>
  <li>Any background and motivation information needed to understand the work as well as any critical hypotheses and assumptions that underlie the work, if appropriate.</li>
  <li>A summary of the contribution and/or results, in sufficient detail for a viewer to understand the work and/or results; especially key details, results and contributions, or the anticipated contributions if the work is at an early stage.</li>
  <li>The relationship to other related efforts, where appropriate. Authors of accepted posters may be asked to point out relationships to work represented by other accepted posters.</li>
  <li>Where to find additional information. This should include but is not restricted to:
    <ul>
      <li>a web site where viewers can go to find additional information about the work</li>
      <li>how to contact the authors, including email addresses</li>
      <li>citations for any papers, books, or other materials that provide additional information</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><em>Demo submissions</em> must describe the purpose of the demo as well as key
ideas that have gone into building the tool or prototype. They can
also showcase results that can be verified by the demo. In addition to
the electronic submission, demo submissions MUST provide a link to the
demo that is available for the period of evaluation.
</p>
<p><em>Fast abstracts</em> must have a clear picture of the problem being solved
or the opinions being stated.  They are not required to be as
structured as a poster but must argue the thesis concisely and
clearly.</p>


<p>
<b>Poster layout guidelines.</b>
The presentation guide drawn up by IEEE and ACM for the Student
Research Competition contains a lot of very useful information on how
to produce a successful poster. In particular: "A picture is worth a
thousand words." Guide viewers to the main issues and help them to
understand the work quickly in order to attract more attention to your
work. Few attendees will stop to read a large poster with dense
text. If you use screen shots, please ensure that the shots print
legibly and that the fonts are large enough to be read
comfortably.
</p>

<p><b>Submission Process.</b> Electronic submission of Poster papers,
Demo papers and Fast Abstracts is required through the DEBS submission
system.  The two-pages paper or fast abstract is to be submitted
initially for evaluation and selection.

If selected, we would require you to finally submit the camera ready
version of the initial version taking into account comments by the
program committee.

Electronic versions of the poster printout do not need to be submitted
through DEBS submission system.
</p>

<p><b>Attendance.</b> At least one of the authors are <strong>required to
register and attend</strong> DEBS 2010 and the scheduled interactive
poster/demo session, staying with their poster/demo so that they can
discuss their work with conference attendees.  Fast abstracts will
receive a 5 minute presentation slot during the conference. Authors of
demos/posters may post an informal schedule along with their
poster/demo, listing times when they plan to be available for
discussion later on during the conference. Sign-up sheets allow
interested viewers to obtain further information. Posters, Demos &amp;
Fast Abstracts are advertised in the Final Program, and authors'
two-page papers for posters and demos will appear in the DEBS 2010
Conference Proceedings, which will be distributed at DEBS
2010. Attendees will be able to learn more about individual posters
continuously during the whole of the conference.</p>

for PhD students working in the broad areas of event-based systems,
complex event processing and publish/subscribe systems. The goal of
the workshop is to support students in their PhD project by providing
a venue to present (preliminary) work, by stimulating feedback from
experienced researchers and by facilitating interactions among PhD
students.</p>

<p>We encourage students who are somewhere in the middle of their
research to submit to this workshop to get feedback on their overall
thesis work. They should be more or less clear about the problem that
they want to target and have take preliminary steps towards the
solution. In addition, we invite students who are at the beginning of
their PhD work and would like to receive feedback on their initial
research ideas, maybe before submitting a first workshop or conference
paper.</p>

<p>Paper presentations will be limited to 20 minutes, with 25 additional
minutes for discussion. This event will be a workshop in the true
meaning of the word, with a focus on discussion and
interaction. Additional social events for all participants will allow
for further interaction.</p>

<p><b>Submission guidelines.</b>  Papers should describe the problem
addressed as part of the PhD work, explain its importance, discuss
shortcomings of existing solutions and give some indication of steps
towards a solution. There should be enough substance to encourage
discussion at the workshop, but the work does not need to be
complete. Please also include a thesis outline and a summary of
further planned work.</p>

<p>Submitted papers should have 3-6 pages for PhD students part-way
through their PhD and 1 page for beginning PhD students. All papers
should be formatted according to the same rules as regular DEBS
papers. Submissions must be single-author with the name of the
supervisor mentioned. Authors should submit their papers in PDF format
through the DEBS EasyChair conference management system, clearly
indicating the type of paper. No copyrighted proceedings will be
published (so future publication of the work in conferences/journals
is not precluded), but accepted submissions will be made available
electronically to all participants.</p>

<p>Important: We will not accept submissions that are typical conference
paper submissions without explicit focus on the PhD work.</p>

<p><b>Structure.</b>  The Program Committee for this workshop consists
mainly of distinguished researchers who are prominent in the field of
event-based systems or who have obtained their own PhDs not too long
ago. Members of the Program Committee will attend the PhD workshop to
encourage and help, answer questions and give feedback. The PhD
workshop will provide a friendly and supportive atmosphere for PhD
students. There will be time to get to know other students and
researcher from a range of countries and backgrounds and to have fun
as well as to work.</p>
