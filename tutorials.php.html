<h2>SQL-based Event Processing: Syntax, Semantics and Implementation</h2>
<div><i>Bernhard Seeger</i> - Philipps-University of Marburg</div>

<p class="tutorial"> During the last few years, more and more event
processing systems emerge with a declarative event processing language
that is closely related to SQL. Though the origin of these systems is
SQL, there are important differences among them regarding the
extension of syntax and semantics. In this tutorial, we give an
overview of the underlying techniques of SQL-based event processing
systems and discuss their differences as well as their
similarities. In particular, we present in detail the generally
accepted extensions of SQL, e.g. windows and pattern matching, to
support the required expressiveness for event processing. This
tutorial is not only limited to the query language, but also gives an
introduction of the underlying algorithms and the optimization of
declarative continuous queries. </p>

<b>Bernhard Seeger</b> is a
professor at Philipps-University of Marburg, heading the research
group for information systems. For more than 15 years he is working on
the design and implementation of new software infrastructures for
future information landscapes. In particular, he has worked on complex
event processing since more than 8 years when he started the PIPES
project that is considered to be the first European research project
on data stream processing.  PIPES put focus on the semantics,
implementation and application of stream processing
infrastructures. The underlying approach to event-processing is
largely inspired by his well-known research results on temporal and
spatial databases.  The results of the research work on PIPES are
published in more than 30 scientific articles, conference reports and
other publications. He is co-founder of the RTM Realtime Monitoring
GmbH, a spin-off of PIPES that offers a CEP infrastructure built
around a SQL-based streaming engine implemented in Java.  Before

<h2>Event processing in Wireless Sensor Networks</h2>
<div><i> Antonio Loureiro </i> - Federal University of Minas Gerais (UFMG), Brazil</div>

<p class="tutorial">
The fast growth in wireless sensors and actuators have the potential to create a global computing infrastructure that is profoundly changing the way people live and work. People may interact with themselves, the physical world, and information services using a wide range of sensor devices connected together, enabling computing and communication at an unprecedented scale and density. This new wireless sensor infrastructure presents a number of challenges especially when it comes to data-intensive applications: enormous scale, different types of data, varying and intermittent connectivity, location dependence and context awareness, limited bandwidth and power capacity, small device size, and multimedia delivery across different networks.
Wireless sensor networks are now evolving from passive observation and reporting systems to active and reactive systems that dynamically evolve in response to complex and rapid spatio-temporal events. Upon the occurrence of events of interest, different network activities and functions start executing, transforming those simple events into meaningful and sophisticated events to an application. This processing chain includes localization, synchronization, information fusion, self-organization, power management, routing, filtering and correlation, query processing, privacy and security, data mining and knowledge discovery, etc. Furthermore, this processing chain should be based on event propagation models to accommodate the requirements of sensor applications.
Compared to event processing already existing on distributed systems available on the Internet, that designed for wireless sensor networks poses unseen challenges due to limitations in sensor storage, processing, and communication capacities. Adding to the aforementioned issues is the curse of dimensionality. In practice, due to their sophistication, sensor events are usually identified by more than one attribute. Management of multi-dimensional data is already a difficult problem in information systems. Doing so under the resource constraints of sensor networks is even much harder.
This tutorial aims at presenting a broad view of event processing in wireless sensor networks in the light of different contexts and backgrounds. The goal is to discuss the different network activities and functions that are related to event processing in wireless sensor networks.

<div>[<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/isvana/debs2010-tutorial-on-epts-reference-architecture-v11c">Tutorial slides</a>]</div>

<p class="tutorial">
This tutorial introduces a reference architecture for event processing, as defined by the EPTS
reference architecture (RA) working group. An event processing reference architecture
allows users to quickly create event processing solutions that adhere to known architectural
qualities, such as performance, scalability, and application coverage. This is supported by the
contributed event processing "architectures" from EPTS working group members, including
vendors and researchers.
</p><p class="tutorial">
The tutorial covers the goals and aims of the reference architecture, and the inputs and
relationships with the contributory architectures, and the methods used to abstract the
(proposed EPTS) Reference Architecture.

<h2>Context aware computing and its utilization in event based systems</h2>
<div><i> Opher Etzion, Ella Rabinovich, Yonit Magid, Inna Skarbovsky, and Nir Zolotorevsky </i> - IBM Haifa</div>
<div>[<a href="http://www.slideshare.net/opher.etzion/debs-2010-context-based-computing-tutorial">Tutorial slides</a>]</div>

<p class="tutorial"> We think and act within contexts; we do things
differently in different circumstances, different times and different
locations. Recently we observe that context is becoming a major
abstraction in the computing world in general and in event-based
systems in particular, Gartner has added two context related items to
its recent hype cycle: context delivery architecture and
context-enriched services. There are various relations between events
and context, on one hand events play vital role in supporting dynamic
contexts, and on the other hand, context is an important abstraction
in event processing. The tutorial is intended to discuss the notion of
context in general, and its projection on event based systems, and to
provide some glimpse into the state of the practice on contexts.  </p>

<h2>Logic-Based Representation, Reasoning and Machine Learning for Event Recognition</h2>
<div><i> Alexander Artikis, Georgios Paliouras, Francois Portet and Anastasios Skarlatidis </i> - Insititute of Informatics and Telecommunications, NCSR "Demokritos", Athens</div>

<p class="tutorial">Today's organisations require techniques for
automated transformation of the large data volumes they collect during
their operations into operational knowledge. This requirement may be
addressed by employing event recognition systems that detect
activities/events of special significance within an organisation,
given streams of 'low-level' information that is very difficult to be
utilised by humans. Numerous event recognition systems have been
proposed in the literature. Recognition systems with a logic-based
representation of event structures, in particular, have been
attracting considerable attention because, among others, they exhibit
a formal, declarative semantics, they haven proven to be efficient and
scalable, and they are supported by machine learning tools automating
the construction and refinement of event structures. In this tutorial
we will review representative approaches of logic-based event
recognition, and discuss open research issues of this field.</p>

<!-- <h2>On Measuring Business Value of CEP-Applications</h2>
<div><i> Rainer von Ammon, Nenad Stojanovic, Guy Sharon, Christian Stary, K. R. Mack Mackenzie, John Sutcliffe-Braithwaite, Thorsten Schoeler, Juraj Dollinger-Lenharcik and Bernhard Seeger</i></div>

<p class="tutorial">
The Event Processing Technical Society has identified the need to
provide the society's view on measuring the business value of event
processing to help in evaluating and adopting the technology. This
tutorial sets the grounds for such a study through the analysis of use
cases from varying domains to consider whether the view on business
value is a general one or needs to be more domain or application
specific. By covering existing approaches, literature about business
value, the tutorial provides the necessary background and direction for
collaborating as a society to complete its task.  CEP must demonstrate
BV in a measurable way, taken as the basis by which an instantiation of
CEP is shown to deliver its mission, according to the purposes,
operating goals, standards of the various entities collaborating in the
enterprise.  It must relate to the business processes and wider aspect
of the business also, so that those involved, typically managers, can
reflect on and tune those processes, and even the mission itself.
Ultimately this views the business as part of a complex ecology that
needs to be modeled so that no aspect of its operation is outside of the
BV net.  That ecology has to be translated into the repertoire of
complex events since that aspect of the performance of business
processes is outsourced to a generic event-driven  Business Process
Management platform. BV comes from a partnership between Business and
technology to measure the right things. In this tutorial we discuss the
problem of measuring BV, what the problems are, which methods or
approaches exist and why they are or are not appropriate.
